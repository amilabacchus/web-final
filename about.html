			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<p><b>Castlecore</b> is an aesthetic rooted in the grandeur of medieval and Renaissance architecture, drawing inspiration from <b>European castles, fortresses, and fairy-tale settings</b>. At its heart, Castlecore romanticizes the craftsmanship, artistry, and atmosphere of a time when buildings were as functional as they were beautiful.</p>

			<h2>HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE STYLES</h2>
			
			<h3>ROMANESQUE (10TH-12TH CENTURY)</h3>
			<p>Romanesque castles were designed primarily for defense and durability. The style features:</p>
			<ul>
  				<li><b>Thick stone walls</b> for protection.</li>
  				<li><b>Rounded arches</b> in doorways and windows.</li>
  				<li><b>Narrow windows</b> to deter invaders and support thick walls.</li>
  				<li><b>Heavy columns</b> and simple, fortress-like exteriors.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>GOTHIC (12TH-16TH CENTURY)</h3>
			<p>Gothic architecture introduced elegance and verticality, moving beyond pure functionality. Known for:</p>
			<ul>
  				<li><b>Pointed arches</b> for structural innovation.</li>
  				<li><b>Ribbed vaults</b> that created soaring ceilings.</li>
  				<li><b>Flying buttresses</b> to support taller, thinner walls.</li>
  				<li><b>Large stained glass windows</b>, often depicting biblical or mythological stories.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>RENAISSANCE (16TH-17TH CENTURY)</h3>
			<p>The Renaissance era saw castles transform from military fortresses into luxurious palaces. This style combined symmetry, classical influences, and ornate details. Key features include:</p>
			<ul>
  				<li><b>Symmetrical layouts</b> inspired by classical Roman architecture.</li>
  				<li><b>Grand facades</b> with decorative carvings and intricate stonework.</li>
  				<li><b>Ornamental gardens</b> and courtyards, showcasing wealth and artistry.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>ROMANTIC AND NEO-GOTHIC (18TH-19TH CENTURY)</h3>
			<p>During the Romantic period, there was a revival of medieval styles, giving rise to Neo-Gothic castles. These structures emphasized fantasy and visual drama, often built as decorative residences rather than defensive strongholds.</p>
			<ul>
  				<li><b>Turrets and towers</b> with pointed spires.</li>
  				<li><b>Elaborate interiors</b> with vaulted ceilings and tapestries.</li>
  				<li><b>Picturesque settings</b>, surrounded by forests, lakes, or mountains.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>WHY CASTLES INSPIRE US</h2>
			<p>Castles symbolize a connection to history, fantasy, and craftsmanship. From the mist-covered towers of Scotland to the sunlit halls of the Loire Valley, these architectural marvels have stood the test of time, evoking feelings of wonder, nostalgia, and grandeur.</p>
			<p>Castlecore invites us to reimagine this enchanting past, drawing on:</p>
			<ul>
  				<li>The <b>beauty of stonework</b> and symmetry.</li>
  				<li>The <b>magic of turrets, halls, and gardens</b>.</li>
  				<li>The stories of <b>royalty, myth, and legend</b> intertwined with castle walls.</li>
			</ul>
